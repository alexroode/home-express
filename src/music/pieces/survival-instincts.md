Inspired by Alaska's beautiful yet harsh landscapes, *Survival Instincts* depicts a twofold existential struggle between
humanity and the natural environment.

Meandering, anxious material comprises the outer and developmental sections of the music. The first, instinctual
struggle comes to mind: battling frostbite and hypothermia, alone in the wild, seeking refuge amid the
unforgiving perils of the Earth's northern extremes.

Two inner sections open powerfully but continually melt away to nothingâ€”evoking the slow recession of glaciers.
The second struggle emerges: the perennial threat of anthropogenic climate change. At times less tangible than the
first, it has so far failed to elicit the same survival response. But it looms large in the psyche of my generation,
and as its consequences continue to materialize, it becomes increasingly untenable to deny its weight.

*Survival Instincts* was originally written for alto saxophone but may be performed on any saxophone.
