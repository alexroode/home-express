*Isomorph* is the spiritual successor to my 2009 band work, [Kinetics](./kinetics). After years of writing nothing but
lyrical music for wind band, I needed to return to the music that originally drew me to the medium.

Harmonically, the piece shares much in common with *Kinetics*—including an abundance of the major-minor 7<sup>th</sup>
chord.

In mathematics, an isomorphism is a reversable mapping between two structures—in a way, *similarity* in a mathematical
sense. I liked this as a cheeky reference to the piece's resemblance to my earlier work.

The piece evolved from three motifs—an innocent theme in compound meter, its minor counterpart, and a foreboding
melody first heard in the low brass. It began to evoke a mischievous creature—sometimes playful, but often turning on
a dime to be brash and boastful. Thus *isomorphic* became *Isomorph*.
