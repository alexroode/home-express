*Jumpstart* is a rhythmic concert opener for piano trio.

At the start, the trio “revs up” until arriving at the main thematic material, a syncopated tune with punchy accents,
with the strings playing in homophony. Two bluesy slow sections put on the brakes briefly—first featuring the violin,
then the cello, who play off of each other expressively.

The piece accelerates to a conclusion in a burst of energy.
