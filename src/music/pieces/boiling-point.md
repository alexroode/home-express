*Boiling Point* depicts a world at a critical juncture. Due to the climate crisis, our collective decisions today have
an unprecedented impact on generations to come. Inaction jeopardizes the stability of our civilization, the survival of
countless nonhuman species, the very habitability of the Earth.

The music begins calmly, ebbing and flowing over unstable harmonies that foreshadow the turmoil ahead. A sudden
outburst begins an increasingly raucous fanfare. After a gradual escalation of tensions, the quartet erupts into an
unbridled wail—a metaphorical boiling-over as we reap what we sow. A final conclusion refers back to the opening
material—the Earth lives on, but what damage has been done?
