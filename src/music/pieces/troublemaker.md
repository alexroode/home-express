*Troublemaker* has the temperament of a child—two innocent and peaceful outer sections wrap a playfully rambunctious
(and slightly deranged) center.

In 2023 I had children on the brain—with local friends bringing their baby daughter to gatherings for the first time,
watching my adorable infant nephew repeatedly tossing food to the dogs from the dinner table, and holding in the news
that my wife and I were expecting a girl of our own.

*Troublemaker* was written for the
