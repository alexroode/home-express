The artsy resort town of Laguna Beach has a singular appeal to those of us who grew up in the cookie cutter suburbs of
Orange County, California. Only a short drive away through the canyon lay beautiful beach and hillside scenery,
 non-chain restaurants, art festivals and museums, and a small town feel.

It seems inevitable that the town would become the location of a number of significant memories.

*Laguna* is an homage to a number of these moments throughout my adolescence and early adulthood.

For its premiere in December 2023, I revised the piece with a new ending, a short cello cadenza, and a an embellished
piano accompaniment.
