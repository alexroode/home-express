Originally conceived for string orchestra, *Night Drive* was inspired by the repetitious 16<sup>th</sup>-note string
rhythms of the baroque and classical repertoire—think Vivaldi's *Four Seasons*.

I completed the opening section first: a melody in repeated 16<sup>ths</sup> over a driving, metronomic accompaniment.
Harmonically the piece began to remind me of a noir film, maybe mobsters crusing through the bad part of town. The
following "B" section evoking love themes from a bygone era of Hollywood and seemed to be a natural next step.

Along the way I reduced the orchestration to a quartet—the more intimate textures seemed well suited to the
piece's nighttime setting.
