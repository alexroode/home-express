Completed in 2009, *Kinetics* was my first serious work for wind band.

Coming from an orchestral background, I was captivated by the driving, rhythmic energy that abounded in the band world.
In particular, Frank Ticheli's *Blue Shades* inspired several key moments in the piece, from the swung
8<sup>th</sup>-note feel to the bombastic climaxes. Performing Ticheli's work with my high school's Wind Symphony was
among the highlights of my entire music education.

In August 2020, I revised the piece significantly in order to enter it into the High School division of the First Annual
Barbara Buehlman Composition Competition. I replaced the lush (but perhaps overlong) central section of my original
version with a compact new developmental section more satisfying to my 2020 tastes. In the outer sections I focused on
more clearly stating and restating the main themes.

To my amazement, the panel of adjudicators—which included Mr. Ticheli himself—selected *Kinetics* as the first prize
winner of the competition, a storybook fortune for a piece written as a tribute to the band repertoire at large.
